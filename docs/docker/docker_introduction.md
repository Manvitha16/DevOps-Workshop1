# Docker overview
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate <br>
your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your<br>
infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.

## The Docker platform
Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container.<br>
The isolation and security lets you run many containers simultaneously on a given host. 

Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you don't need to rely on what's<br>
installed on the host. You can share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the <br>
same container that works in the same way.

## What can I use Docker for?
 - Fast, consistent delivery of your applications.
 - Streamline development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environments using local containers. 
 - Containers are great for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows.

## Responsive deployment and scaling
Docker's container-based platform allows for highly portable workloads. Docker containers can run on a developer's <br>
local laptop, on physical or virtual machines in a data center, on cloud providers, or in a mixture of environments.
